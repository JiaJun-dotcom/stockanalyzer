Pattern Recognition:
- Need to train two types of models first, one for pattern classification(double top or double bottom)
another for segmentation(teach model where the pattern is in the image, which area, how to spot)

ResNet = "Residual Network", 
a type of neural network architecture used for image classification.

Stacks lots of image filters(layers), the deeper the layers, the more the 
model can understand. 
ResNET is a smart, pretrained neural network that learned from millions of
images using "shortcut connections" that skip layers.

Load a pretrained ResNet model (like ResNet18 or ResNet50) from PyTorch or 
TensorFlow.
Replace the last layer to predict just two classes: “Double Top” or 
“Double Bottom”.
Train it on your labeled pattern images.
^^ Transfer Learning


Segmentation model:
1. You need input images (stock charts).
2. And mask images — black-and-white images,
where the white region shows where the pattern is.
3. Feed them to a segmentation model (like U-Net).
4. Train it to predict the mask from the chart image.
